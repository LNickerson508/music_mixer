Repo for Music Mixer assignment for MMED-1055: Web Authoring

This project will involve the creation of a web-page that is able to play a variety of looping nature sounds, which will be selected via svg icons. 
It will involve the use of html, css, and javascript to handle the animations and sounds that will be played after being selected.

I plan to have each different "element" of the picture to have a selectable and dragable icon that can be inserted into the mixer to add on to the existing soundscape, which will feature ambiances of a river, campfire, wind, brids, and insects
